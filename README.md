# YouTube Search App

This is a YouTube-inspired search application built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Vite. The app fetches video data from the YouTube API and displays a list of search results, allowing users to browse trending videos or search for specific content.

## Features

- **Search for Videos**: Users can type in the search bar to fetch and display relevant YouTube videos.
- **Trending Videos**: Displays trending videos by default when no search query is provided.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS for a responsive, YouTube-like user experience.


## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
- A **YouTube API Key** for accessing video data. You can obtain this by creating a project in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and enabling the YouTube Data API v3.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-search-react.git
